SecureCipher is a simple Python script that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift key.

Features:
* Encryption: Encrypt plain text messages with a user-defined shift key.
* Decryption: Decrypt cipher text messages with the corresponding shift key.
* User Interaction: Interactive command-line interface for easy encryption and decryption operations.
* Alphabet Handling: Utilizes the string module to access the English alphabet and handle input validation.
* Flexible Usage: Suitable for educational purposes, basic cryptographic tasks, or as part of a larger project.
